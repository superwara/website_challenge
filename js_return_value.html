 How to tell the return value of a function?
 So if you want to know the return value of a function, there are two ways to do so:
 declare a variable and store it into it. and of course, print it. 
 use the function as the argument of document.write().

Code:

*/
            
                let abc = document.write("Hello");        //function called (writes "Hello"), and the return value of the write function is stored into the variable abc
                document.write("<br>");
                document.write(abc);                      //writes the return value of the abc function: "undefined"       
                document.write(document.write("Hello"));  //function called (writes "Hello"), and writes the return value of the function: "undefined"
            
        
/* 
Result:
Hello
undefinedHelloundefined
*/

</script>
